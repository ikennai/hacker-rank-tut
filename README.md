# Hacker Rank Tutorial

## Overview

The goal with this app is to gain familiarity with the implementation of GraphQL. The tutorial I'll be following is available at http://www.howtographql.com.

I've chosen the React + Apollo track. However since I've been currently coding a lot with vue and use vue and Nuxt 3 daily I will be using Nuxt 3 to complete the React/Frontend pieces of this application. I will also (if time allows) add additional styling using Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI

## Nuxt 3

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
